4. Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

5. Write a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

6. Write a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.

7. Write a function that checks if a number is prime.

8. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of its elements.

9. Write a function that filters an array to include only positive numbers.

10. Write a function to calculate the sum of digits of a given number.

11. Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of every word in a given sentence.

12. Write a function to return number of digits in given number

13. Write a function to check whether given number is armstrong or not (An Armstrong number is one where the sum of its digits each
    raised to the power of the number of
    digits equals the number itself (e.g., 153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³))
